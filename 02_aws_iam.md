# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for Beginners

## Introduction
- If you're a newbie to AWS, your experience might go something like this:
  - You create a new AWS account.
  - You log into the AWS console as the root user.
  - You build things, test them, and everything works fine.
  - You deploy an app or feature to users or friends for testing.
  - Suddenly, nothing works, and you can't access things or they fall apart.

- You then realize the importance of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and start Googling for help.
- This was my experience when I started, so in this guide, I'll explain what I wish I had known about IAM in an easy-to-grasp way.

## What is IAM?
- IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service used to securely control access to AWS resources.
- It controls:
  - **Authentication**: Who can access AWS.
  - **Authorization**: What actions they can perform.

## Four Main Concepts in IAM
1. **Users**
2. **Groups**
3. **Roles**
4. **Policies**

Let's cover these one step at a time by doing things in the AWS console.

## Creating Users
1. **Log into the AWS Console**
2. **Navigate to IAM**
   - Type "IAM" in the search bar and click on "Identity and Access Management".
3. **Add Users**
   - Click on "Users" and then "Add users".
   - Example: Create users Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute.
   - Select the access type (programmatic access or management console access).
   - For console access, generate or specify a password.

4. **Review and Create Users**
   - Skip tags and review.
   - By default, users have no permissions.
   - Create users and note down login details.

## Creating Groups
1. **Navigate to User Groups**
   - Click on "User groups" on the left.
2. **Create Groups**
   - Create groups such as "Developers", "Testers", and "Admins".
   - Add users to groups (e.g., Pam Beasley to Developers, Dwight Schrute to Testers, Michael Scott to Admins).

## Understanding Roles
- **Roles**: Identities with specific permissions, but no credentials.
- Roles can be assumed temporarily by entities (users, applications, etc.).
- Example: An EC2 instance needing access to S3 and CloudWatch.
  - Create an IAM role with appropriate permissions.
  - Assign the role to the EC2 instance at creation.
  - The instance assumes the role without hard-coded credentials.

## Creating Roles
1. **Navigate to Roles**
   - Click on "Roles" on the left.
2. **Create a Role**
   - Select a use case (e.g., EC2).
   - Assign permissions (e.g., S3 and CloudWatch access).

## Policies
- **Policies**: Define who can do what to which resources and when.
- **Policy Structure**:
  - **Effect**: Allow or Deny (default is Deny).
  - **Action**: API calls to services (e.g., s3:DeleteBucket).
  - **Resource**: Specific resources (e.g., an S3 bucket).
  - **Conditions**: Optional, controls when the policy applies.

### Example Policy
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Attaching Policies

## Policies need to be attached to users, groups, or roles to take effect.

### Attaching Policies to Users/Groups
1. **Navigate to Users/Groups**
   - Click on "Users" or "User groups".
2. **Select User/Group**
   - Click on the user or group name.
3. **Attach Policies**
   - Add permissions by attaching policies.
   - Example: Attach "S3 Full Access" to the "Testers" group.

### Attaching Policies to Roles
1. **Navigate to Roles**
   - Click on "Roles" on the left.
2. **Select Role**
   - Click on the role name.
3. **Attach Policies**
   - Add permissions by attaching policies.
   - Example: Attach "EC2 Full Access" to a role for EC2 instances.

## Best Practices
- **Use IAM Users, Not Root Account**
  - Root account has full access, including billing.
  - Create IAM users with the least permissions needed.
  - Lock away root credentials and avoid using them.

- **Least Privilege Principle**
  - Grant only the permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.
  - Regularly review and adjust permissions as needed.

- **Use Roles for Applications**
  - Assign roles to applications (e.g., EC2 instances) instead of hard-coding credentials.
  - Roles provide temporary credentials and are more secure.

- **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
  - Add an extra layer of security for user access.

- **Monitor and Audit IAM Activity**
  - Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor IAM activity.
  - Regularly review logs for any unusual or unauthorized activity.

## Summary
- IAM helps control access to AWS resources securely.
- Key concepts include Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies.
- Best practices involve using IAM users, managing permissions through policies, and following security guidelines.

## Further Learning
- Explore more IAM features and best practices through AWS documentation and tutorials.
- Consider subscribing to AWS updates and tutorials for ongoing learning.

## Notes
- Always test permissions in a safe environment before deploying to production.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies to maintain security and compliance.
- Stay updated with AWS best practices and security recommendations.
