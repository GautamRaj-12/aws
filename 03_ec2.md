## Introduction
- **Characters:**
  - Sophia: Works for a startup.
  - Alex: Sophia's boss who came up with the idea.
  - **Startup Idea:** Website and mobile app to show locations of air pumps for tires.

## Initial Setup
- **Current Hosting:**

## Problem
- **Increased Traffic:**
  - A mention on Reddit leads to a surge in website traffic.

- **Solution Proposal:**
  - Sophia suggests switching to AWS and using EC2 instances.

## Introduction to EC2
- **What is EC2?**
  - Stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
  - A virtual server rented in AWS.
  - Pay for what you use.
- **Benefits of EC2:**
  - **Scalability:** Easily scale up or down.
  - **Reliability:** Automatic replacement of failed servers.
  - **Integration:** Works seamlessly with other AWS services.
  - **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use.

## Creating an EC2 Instance
- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
  - **AWS Management Console:** Log in and navigate to EC2.
  - **Launch Instance:**
    1. **Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
       - Select an AMI with the required OS and software.
       - Example: Windows Server 2019 Base (Free Tier Eligible).
    2. **Choose Instance Type:**
       - Example: t2.micro (Free Tier Eligible).
    3. **Configure Instance Details:**
       - Default settings for most options.
       - **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Use default.
       - **Shutdown Behavior:** Set to "Stop".
    4. **Add Storage:**
       - Default 30GB SSD.
    5. **Add Tags:**
       - Example: Tag for environment set to "development".
    6. **Configure Security Group:**
       - Example: Allow RDP access on port 3389.
       - **Security Warning:** Avoid opening RDP to all IP addresses.
    7. **Review and Launch:**
       - Review settings and launch the instance.
       - Create and download a key pair for logging in.

## Connecting to the Instance
- **Steps to Connect:**
  - **Download Remote Desktop File:** Connect using RDP.
  - **Retrieve Administrator Password:** Use the key pair to decrypt.
  - **Log In:** Enter the password and connect to the instance.

## Post-Setup
- **Using the Instance:**
  - Conduct development work or host the application.
- **Important Reminder:**
  - **Terminate Instance:** To avoid unnecessary charges, terminate the instance after use.

## Conclusion
